# Past Interests

I received B.Eng. from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo.
I was in [Yoshimura & Izmi Lab](http://save.sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html), whose members are mainly interested in FEM/MPS and *Traffic Simulation*.

My graduate thesis was about using stochastic 2D agents for generating
the cooperative behaviors in the traffic simulation. (The paper is in
Japanese, so I do not make it public here.)
